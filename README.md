# Booking System

## To Do

- Create log in/sign up (also have an admin tag for certain users)
- Schedule appointment
  - Functionality to view who is available and when
  - Users should only be able to book in advance of 1 month (potential feature)
- Use the dummy Stripe API for payments/deposits
- Past appointments
- Edit an appointment
- Cancel an appointment (add a feat like unable to cancel 24 hours in advance)
- Email feature (every time an appointment is scheduled, edited or cancelled)
- Admins etc. should be able to view scheduled appointments with user
  - Potential edge case: should these users be able to edit/remove appointments
- Potential later feature: allow user to submit feedback/rating, with an average rating for users logged in
